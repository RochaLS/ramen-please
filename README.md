# Ramen Please
Ramen App to help users to find Ramen restaurants close to their location.

  Everyone loves Ramen, so I decided to create a small app that can help users find ramen restaurants around their location no matter where they are!
  I used Google Places API to get the necessary restaurant information, and then using Google Routes to get the route to the user's selected restaurant. There are still some more features I would like to add in the future like a favorites list and stuff... but for now that's it!
  
  Thank you so much,
